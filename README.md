## Predicting Success in College Football using the Blue-Chip Ratio

This project examined if the quantity of talented players on a team can predict the outcome of a college season. 
This is known as the “blue-chip ratio”. This ratio is the ratio of 4 and 5 star recruited players when compared to 
the rest of the team. A blue-chip ratio greater than 50% is typically indicative of a greater chance for success in any given year.<br>

Dependent variable: number of wins in a team's season record.<br>
Independent variable: the blue-chip ratio.<br>
Outcome: the number of players that were blue-chips as a recruit was not a major factor in winning college football games.
